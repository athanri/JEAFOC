With current treatments often falling short in efficacy, safety, and patient convenience, the Company has identified promising naturally derived receptor binding proteins, one of which, CB-24 crotoxin, it has progressed into Phase I trials using a novel intra-patient dose escalating protocol.</p>
                            <p class="barlow align-middle">The drug has shown excellent safety, minimal side-effects and stabilisation of disease in several  patients in Phase Ib (6 patients evaluated) multi-cancer trials. Delivered as a user friendly at-home monotherapy using infusion pumps, the patients are monitored remotely requiring visits to clinic twice weekly for dose escalation.  Part funded by the European Innovation Council, Phase Ic clinical trials will commence in 2024 to identify MTD and optimum treatment protocol, with a view to commencing Phase II trials in NSCLC 2025/26, in this potentially game-changing cancer therapeutic.</p>

                            <p class="barlow align-middle">Breakthrough Cancer Research is an Irish medical research charity focused on cancer. We work to significantly impact the number of people who can survive this disease. We invest in world-class research to impact patients' quality of life and save lives. We are particularly focused on improving outcomes for those cancers, often called poor prognosis or low survival cancers, which are poorly served by current treatment options. In 2023 we launched our new research strategy (‘Making More Survivors’), building on immense success already delivered, sharpening our focus to channel even greater investment into seven specific low survival cancers, which are responsible for nearly half of all cancer deaths annually in Ireland and worldwide. Namely, Brain, Oesophageal, Lung, Liver, Stomach, Pancreatic and Ovarian cancers.</p>
                            <p class="barlow align-middle">Breakthrough drives progress through innovative research programmes aimed at transforming the treatment and care for these cancers to deliver our bold vision: 100% survival for 100% of cancers.</p>
